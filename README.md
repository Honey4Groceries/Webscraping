## Introduction
This document serves as a design document for the webscraping portion of the Honey For Groceries project. It will serve the purpose of documenting design iterations and considerations along with milestones along the way

## Overview
The webscraping part of the Honey for Groceries project serves as the data source for the database

## Context
Describe the following:
* What is the problem that this part of the project is trying to solve?
* Why is this approach necessary to solve this problem?

## Goals (and non-goals)
Describe which problems will be fixed and which will **not** be fixed

## Milestones
Divide up the milestone into a sprint for spring quarter

## Technical Architecture
Provide big picture of the technical architecture *then* jam pack it with details. Aim to have so many details that another engineer may be able to implement the solution that you described. Also describe file structure and how things will be done

## Testing and Monitoring
How to run tests for the webscrapers? How to run monitor webscraping status?

## Alternative Architecture
List alternative architectures you have considered

## Lessons Learned
### Server-side Rendered Websites
A lot of websites are 

## Problems to Consider
